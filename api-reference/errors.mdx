title: 'Errors'
description: 'Full Fabric uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers (these are rare).'

## HTTP status code summary

```json
200 - OK: Everything worked as expected.
400 - Bad Request: The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 - Unauthorized: No valid API key provided.
402 - Request Failed: The parameters were valid but the request failed.
404 - Not Found: The requested resource doesn't exist.
422 - Unprocessable Entity: The request is understood but invalid, often due to failed validation.
429 - Too Many Requests: Too many requests hit the API too quickly.
50x - Server Errors: Something went wrong on our end. (These are rare.)
```

## Dealing with API errors
You may find that you've encountered successive errors when trying to access the API.

Rather than ignore repeated 4xx and 5xx status codes, you should ensure that you're correctly interacting with the API. For example, if an endpoint requests a string and you're passing it a numeric value, you're going to receive a validation error, and your call won't succeed. Similarly, attempting to access an unauthorized or nonexistent endpoint will result in a 4xx error.

<Warning>

Intentionally ignoring repeated validation errors may result in the suspension of your app for abuse.
