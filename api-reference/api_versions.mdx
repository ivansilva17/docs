description: 'Your API version controls the API you see (e.g. what properties you
see in responses, what parameters youâ€™re permitted to send in requests).'

<Note>
  When we change the API in a backwards-incompatible way, we release a new dated version.

## Specifying API version

All requests require an API version. You can specify a version via the Accept header as below.

```json
Accept: application/json;version=2021-04-13
```
Alternatively, you can also the specify a version via an X-API-Version header in which case you can remove the version from the Accept header.

```json
X-API-Version: 2021-04-13
Accept: application/json
```
