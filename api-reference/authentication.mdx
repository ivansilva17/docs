title: 'Authentication'
description: 'Authenticate your account when using the API by including your secret API token in the request. Your API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secret! Do not share your secret API tokens in publicly accessible areas, client-side code, and so forth.'
---
<Warning>

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

</Warning>

## Authentication via the FF-Auth header

Set a FF-Auth header with your secret API token to authenticate the request.

```shell
curl https://_.fullfabric.com/apis/profiles/profiles/57232561dfc41880050001de \
  -H "Accept: application/json; version=2021-04-13" \
  -H "FF-Auth: TOKEN"
```
